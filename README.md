# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Overview of Project
Louise’s play *Fever* was $400 short from its fundraising goal in only about a month's span. Now, she wants to understand how other plays fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset that I’ve already combed through, I visualized campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals
### Purpose 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  The month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May. However, May, June, July and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  A goal of less than $1,000 has the highest chances of having a successful outcome on a play. On the other hand, the goal range of $45,000-$49,999 has a 100% chance of having a failed outcome.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
